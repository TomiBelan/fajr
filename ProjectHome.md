The goal of this project is to provide nice and clean interface for AIS2 (Akademický informačný systém) for Comenius University.

# Quick start #

Just login to the site.

There are several versions to choose from:

  * Current stable version: https://fajr.fmph.uniba.sk/
> > This is the stable version configured to use ais2.uniba.sk that you want to use in most cases.
  * Demo version: https://fajr.fmph.uniba.sk/demo/
> > This is the demo version configured to use fake backend with fake data. Does not require login and does not connect to AIS2.
  * Current preview BETA version: https://fajr.fmph.uniba.sk/beta/
> > This is (newer) preview version configured to use ais2-beta.uniba.sk (albeit you can change the server to ais2.uniba.sk), so you can freely experiment with it and you can't screw up your regular AIS information. Information in ais2-beta.uniba.sk is copied from ais2.uniba.sk once upon a time and thus may not be 100% accurate.
